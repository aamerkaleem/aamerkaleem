<h3>History</h3><hr>
<div class="para2">
    <p> <strong> Emperor Shah Jahan</strong> commissioned construction of the Red Fort on<mark> 12 May 1638,</mark> when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to<mark> Delhi</mark>. Originally red and white, Shah Jahan's favourite colours,<sup> [7]</sup> its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. <sup> [8][9]</sup> The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed the moats surrounding most of the walls. <sup> [10]</sup> Construction began in the sacred Islamic month of <mark> Muharram, on 13 May 1638 </mark>.[11]: 01  Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed on<mark> 6 April 1648</mark> <sup> [12][13][14]</sup> Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort's boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh Fort.[11]: 04  The fortress-palace was a focal point of the city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old Delhi. Shah Jahan's successor, Aurangzeb, added the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) to the emperor's private quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main gates to make the entrance to the palace more circuitous.[11]: 08 

        The administrative and fiscal structure of the Mughal dynasty declined after Aurangzeb, and the 18th century saw a degeneration of the palace. In 1712 Jahandar Shah became the Mughal Emperor. Within a year of beginning his rule, Shah was murdered and replaced by Farrukhsiyar. In 1739, Persian emperor Nadir Shah easily defeated the strong Mughal army of around 200,000 soldiers,[15] plundering the Red Fort, including the Peacock Throne. Nadir Shah returned to Persia after three months, leaving a destroyed city and a weakened Mughal empire to Muhammad Shah.[11]: 09  The internal weakness of the Mughal Empire made the Mughals only titular rulers of Delhi, and a 1752 treaty made the Marathas protectors of the throne at Delhi.[16][17] The 1758 Maratha victory at Sirhind aided by the Sikhs and successive defeat at Panipat[18] placed them in further conflict with Ahmad Shah Durrani.[19][20]
        
        In 1760, the Marathas removed and melted the silver ceiling of the Diwan-i-Khas to raise funds for the defence of Delhi from the armies of Ahmed Shah Durrani.[21][22] In 1761, after the Marathas lost the third battle of Panipat, Delhi was raided by Ahmed Shah Durrani. Ten years later, the Marathas recaptured Delhi from the Rohilla Afghans under the leadership of Visaji Biniwale, Ramchandra Kanade, Mahadji Scindia and Tukoji Holkar and placed their puppet Mughal emperor Shah Alam II on the throne.[11]: 10 </p>
