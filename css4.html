    <h1>Tablighi Jamaat</h1> <hr>
    <div class="div1">
    <p> <strong> Tablighi Jamaat </strong>(lit. 'Society of Preachers',[5][6] also translated as "propagation party" or "preaching party")[2] is a transnational Sunni Islamic missionary movement[2][3][4] that focuses on exhorting Muslims and encouraging fellow members to return to practising their religion as per the Islamic prophet Muhammad[7]. The organisation is estimated to have between 12 and 80 million adherents worldwide,[1] with the majority living in South Asia;[8][9] their presence is attested in 150 countries,[3][4] whereas other estimates attest an approximate number between 180[10] and 200 countries.[11] It has been deemed as "one of the most influential religious movements in 20th-century Islam."[12]

        Established in 1926 by the Muhammad Ilyas al-Kandhlawi, in the Mewat region of India, it developed as a response to the perceived deterioration of moral values and the supposed neglect of aspects of Islam.[2] The movement aims for the spiritual reformation of Islam by working at the grassroots level.[11][13] The teachings of Tabligh Jamaat are expressed in "Six Principles": Kalimah (Declaration of faith), Salah (Prayer), Ilm-o-zikr (Reading and Remembrance), Ikraam-e-Muslim (Respect of Muslim), Ikhlas-e-Niyyat (Sincerity of intention), and Dawat-o-Tableegh (Proselytizaton).[14]

<h2>History</h2>
<div class="div2">
    <p>The emergence of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely with the rise of various Hindu revivalist movements such as Shuddhi (purification) and Sanghatan (consolidation) launched in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity.</p>

</div>
<h1>Expansion</h1>
<div class="div3">
 <hr>
<p>The group began to expand its activities in 1946. The initial expansion within South Asia happened immediately after the partition of India in 1947, when the Pakistan Chapter was established in the hinterlands of Raiwind town near Lahore, Pakistan. The Pakistan Chapter remained the largest until Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan in 1971. Today, the largest Chapter is Bangladesh followed by the second largest in Pakistan. Within two decades of its establishment, the group reached Southwest and Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America.[27] The Tablighi Jamaat's aversion to politics, and also its lack of any direct and practical economic-political-social viewpoints, helped it enter and operate in societies, especially western countries and societies where politically active religious groups faced restrictions.</p>
</div>
<h1>Foreign missions</h1>
<div class="div4">The first foreign missions were sent to the Hejaz (western Saudi Arabia) and Britain in 1946.[28] The United States followed and during the 1970s and 1980s the Tablighi Jamaat also established a large presence in continental Europe.[25] In France it was introduced in the 1960s, and grew significantly in the two decades following 1970.[29]

    In France, as of 2004, it was represented on the French Council of the Muslim Faith.[25] During the first half-decade of the 21st century Tablighi Jamaat went through a major revival in France, reaching 100,000 followers by 2006.[30] However, the United Kingdom is the current focus of the movement in Europe, primarily due to the large South Asian population that began to arrive there in the 1960s.[31] By 2007, Tablighi Jamaat members were situated at 600 of Britain's 1,350 mosques.[32]
    
    After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the movement made inroads into Central Asia. As of 2007, it was estimated that 10,000 Tablighi Jamaat members could be found in Kyrgyzstan.[33]
    
    Pew Research Center estimates there are between 12 and 80 million adherents, spread across more than 150 countries.[10] By some measures this made Tablighi Jamaat the largest Muslim movement in the World.[citation needed] The majority of the followers of the Tablighi Jamaat live in South Asia.[11][9] It is estimated that nearly 50,000 members of Tablighi Jamaat are active in the United States</div> 
    <h1>Beliefs and objectives</h1> <hr>
    <div class="div5">Members of Tabligh Jamat are allowed to follow their own fiqh as long as it does not deviate from Sunni Islam.[15][31] Tablighi Jamaat defines its objective with reference to the concept of Dawah, the proselytizing or preaching of Islam. Tablighi Jamaat interprets Dawah as enjoining good and forbidding evil only and defines its objective within the framework of two particular Qur'anic verses which refer to this mission.[34] Those two verses are:[35]

        Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) to Allah, works righteousness, and says, "I am of the muslims (those who submit to Allah) "?
        
        — Qur'an, sura (chapter) 41 (Fussilat), ayah (verse) 33[36]
        Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity.
        
        — Qur'an sura (chapter) 3 (Al-i-Imran), ayah (verse) 104[20]
        The method adopted by Muhammad Ilyas was to organise units (called jamaats, Arabic: جماعاتِ meaning Assembly) of at least ten persons and send them to various villages or neighborhoods to preach. These outings, Dawah tours (see below), are now organised by Tablighi Jamaat leaders.[37] In these tours, emphasis is laid on "A hadith about virtues of action" (imitating Muhammad). In the ahadith (reported sayings of Muhammad) of fazail (virtues) these has been called Eemaan (faith) and Ihtisab (for the sake of Allah) and Tablighi Jamaat believes this is the most vital deriving force for reward in akhirah (afterlife). The Tablighi Jamaat founder Ilyas preached that knowledge of virtues and A'amalu-Saliha (Good Deeds and Actions) takes precedence over the knowledge of Masa'il (jurisprudence). Knowing jurisprudence detail (Fara'id (mandates) and Sunan (traditions) of Salat) is useful only if a person is ready to perform rituals such as offering Salat.[38] They insist that the best way of learning is teaching and encouraging others, with the books prescribed by Tabligi Jamaat Movement in the light of Quran and Hadith stories of Prophets, Sahaba (Companions of Prophet) and Awlia Allah ("Friends of Allah").[39] [Note 1] A collection of books, usually referred as Tablighi Nisaab (Tablighi Curriculum), is recommended by Tabligh Jamaat elders for general reading. This set includes four books namely (Hayatus Sahabah, Fazail-e-Amaal, Fazail-e-Sadqaat and Muntakhab Ahadith)</div>

        <h1>Six Attributes (Sifāt)</h1>
        <div class="div6">Tablighi Jamaat visits a village or neighborhood, invites the local Muslims to assemble in the mosque and present their message in the form of Six Attributes.These six Attributes were derived from the lives of the companions of Muhammad. It is stated in one narration, "My Sahabah (companions) are like [guiding] stars, whosoever follows [any] one of them will be guided."[44] [(Sahih Muslim 6466; 207-(2531) Darussalam ed.), Used in notable Fiqh books for 'judging' purpose]. Muslim's believe, they were the best human beings after Muhammad.Muhammad Ilyas just articulated six demands in the form of Six Sifāt which are quintessential to Tablighi Jamaat's teachings. Its basically a discussion about 6 special Attributes that one have to achieve, which will just make it Easy to follow the entire Dīn. According to them, the objectives are:

            Kalimah/ ʾīmān [believe with conviction]: 'lā ilāha illā -llāh (There is) No god but Allah, Muḥammadur rasūlu -llāh; is a sacred pledge of man with GOD (believe with conviction & adopt the lifestyle) which should transform one's Certainty, Lifestyle & Affection [from Creation to Creator; Other's to Sunnah & Worldly to Afterlife].
            Namaz/Salah [Performing the prescribed prayers]: Achieve sahaba standard salah & certainty so that one can get spiritual elevation, piety and a life free from the ills of the material world.
            Ilm with Zikr [Knowledge with Remembrance]: One have to achieve enough wisdom so that (A) able to differentiate between what is permissible-impermissible, purity-impurity, legitimacy-illegitimacy in all aspects of his/her life (B) Know that, at any given moment, in one's 24-hour existence, what GOD wants of him/ her. Ilm, Dhikr are interconnected & to get benefit one have to achieve them simultaneously. At each moment in one's worldly existence he/she have to achieve, a conscious awareness, nearness, a ta’aluq [relationship] and Ma'rifa [knowledge] of GOD.
            Ikram al-Muslim [Honoring Muslims]: Treat fellow Muslims with honor and deference. with all the rest of the Ummah (and by extension, all of creation) – be based on love, compassion, honor, generosity and respect. Instead of demanding them, one should not only forgo his/her rights, but become deeply concerned with giving others at least their due (rights stipulated by the Sacred Law).
            Sahih Niyyah/ Ikhlāṣ [Only for GOD]: Sincerity of Intention – Reforming one's life in supplication to GOD by performing every human action (especially ibadah & Muamalat) for the sake of GOD and toward the goal of self-transformation".
            Dawah & Tabligh/ Tabligh-i-waqt [Invitation and Conveyance]: Inviting and Preaching – The sparing of time to live a life based on faith and learning its virtues, following in the footsteps of Muhammad, and taking His message door to door for the sake of faith, so that (A) All of humanity (Including Oneself) until the Day Reckoning embodies the first five of the Six Attributes & (B) All of humanity attains salvation, saved from Hellfire by achieving Heaven</div>
