    <h1>Tipu Sultan</h1>   <hr>
    <div class="div1">
        <p>Tipu Sultan (born Sultan Fateh Ali Sahab Tipu,[5] 01 December 1751 – 4 May 1799),[1][6] also known as the Tiger of Mysore,[7] was the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore based in South India and a pioneer of rocket artillery.[citation needed] He introduced a number of administrative innovations during his rule, including a new coinage system and calendar,[8] and a new land revenue system which initiated the growth of the Mysore silk industry.[9] He expanded the iron-cased Mysorean rockets and commissioned the military manual Fathul Mujahidin. He deployed the rockets against advances of British forces and their allies during the Anglo-Mysore Wars, including the Battle of Pollilur and Siege of Srirangapatna.</p>


   
        <p>Tipu Sultan and his father used their French-trained army in alliance with the French in their struggle with the British,[10] and in Mysore's struggles with other surrounding powers, against the Marathas, Sira, and rulers of Malabar, Kodagu, Bednore, Carnatic, and Travancore. Tipu's father, Hyder Ali, rose to power and Tipu succeeded him as the ruler of Mysore upon his father's death in 1782. He won important victories against the British in the Second Anglo-Mysore War and negotiated the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore with them after his father died from cancer in December 1782 during the Second Anglo-Mysore War.

            Tipu's conflicts with his neighbours included the Maratha–Mysore War which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Gajendragad.[11] The treaty required that Tipu Sultan pay 4.8 million rupees as a one-time war cost to the Marathas, and an annual tribute of 1.2 million rupees in addition to returning all the territory captured by Hyder Ali</p>
