        <p>Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad[4] (Persian: محی‌الدین محمد) (3 November 1618 – 3 March 1707),[1] commonly known by the sobriquet Aurangzeb (Persian: اورنگزیب, lit. 'Ornament of the Throne')[4] or by his regnal title Alamgir (Persian: "Conqueror of the World"),[5] was the sixth Mughal emperor, who ruled over almost the entire Indian subcontinent for a period of 49 years.[6][7][8] Widely considered to be the last effective ruler of the Mughal Empire,[9] Aurangzeb compiled the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, and was among the few monarchs to have fully established Sharia law and Islamic economics throughout the Indian subcontinent.[10][11] He was an accomplished military leader[12] whose rule has been the subject of praise, though he has also been described as the most controversial ruler in Indian history.[13]

            He was a notable expansionist; during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its great extent, ruling over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent.[14] During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres,[15] and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects.[14] Under his reign, India surpassed Qing China to become the world's largest economy and biggest manufacturing power, worth nearly a quarter of global GDP and more than the entirety of Western Europe, and its largest and wealthiest subdivision, the Bengal Subah,[16] signaled proto-industrialization.[17][18][19]
            
            Aurangzeb was noted for his religious piety; he memorized the entire Quran, studied hadiths and stringently observed the rituals of Islam,[20][21] and "transcribe[d] copies of the Quran."[22][23] He also patronized works of Islamic and Arabic calligraphy.[24]</p>
